# Cardea_labs

This was an app for a local hackathon held in my college.

This app connects to a cardiogram hardware with bluetooth inn it,
the main aim of the app was to plot the pulse on an graph recieved through bluetooth by the cardiogram in real time 
and analyse the results and store it on a remote server using httppost.
